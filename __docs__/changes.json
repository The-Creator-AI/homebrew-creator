    "The Homebrew formula should successfully install the 'creator' application, including all dependencies.",
    "The formula should provide a simple command to install 'creator' (e.g., `brew install creator`).",
    "The formula should correctly identify and install all necessary dependencies (e.g., Node.js, npm, other required packages).",
    "The formula should include tests to ensure that the installation process is working correctly.",
    "The formula should be well-documented with clear instructions on how to install and use 'creator' on macOS.",
    "The formula should be published to the Homebrew repository, making it readily available to other users."
